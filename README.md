Hi, I'm an undergrad student studying Information Technology. I'm good at solving problems. My current position in imochaWorks is problem setter (DSA) and I've solved over 450 leetcode questions to improve my data structure and algorithm skills. In addition, I am a web developer with good skills in JavaScript, React JS, Node JS, and MongoDB. My interest is in software development opportunities (SDE-role).

I worked as a Problem Setter  at iMochaWorks and it has been an amazing experience for me. Problem setting itself has allowed me to brush up on all my previously learned concepts including DSA.
