Hi, I'm an undergrad student studying Information Technology. I'm good at solving problems. My current position in imochaWorks is problem setter (DSA) and I've solved over 450 leetcode questions to improve my data structure and algorithm skills. In addition, I am a web developer with good skills in JavaScript, React JS, Node JS, and MongoDB. My interest is in software development opportunities (SDE-role).
